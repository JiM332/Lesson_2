      <div class="text">
         <p>
            At 16 years old, s1mple first appeared in HLTV.org's records in late 2013 as a representative of Ukraine in the European Champions Cup 2013. It was there that he first teamed up with Andrey "B1ad3" Gorodenskiy, <br> who would then help the youngster enter the semi-professional scene, get his first international experience in Courage, and give him several chances to show his worth in future teams.
         </p>
         <p>
            Building up a reputation for being a difficult player to work with, s1mple did not last long in many of his teams, and the fact that he received a long ban from ESL for attempting to dodge a previous ban for cheating in 1.6 didn't help his career early on either, <br> as it caused him to miss several of the top organizer's large events including two Majors in 2015. His potential was undeniable, however, as with virtually no prior experience he immediately put up remarkable numbers against some of the world's best teams with HellRaisers <br> and FlipSid3, averaging a 1.18 rating in 2014-2015.
         </p>

         <p>
            ZywOo became one of two rookies, following Marcelo "coldzera" David, to win a Top 20 player of the year award in 2019, repeating the feat the following year to make it two for two and cement his name early on as one of the game's greats, <br> although this year he gave up the throne to an otherworldly Aleksandr "s1mple" Kostyliev and had to settle for second place — outpacing the other two players, Dmitry "sh1ro" Sokolov and Nikola "NiKo" Kovač, in a tight-knit top four.
         </p>
         <p>
            It was in 2017 that murmurs of a new virtuoso in the making came out of France's lower tiers, what the French call the 'sub-top,' a youngster playing for E-Corp and WySix by the name of ZywOo, <br> although his first matches on HLTV's record are from the summer of 2016 when he competed in several qualifiers with a mix team under the name of nevermind alongside the likes of Robin "ropz" Kool and Nemanja "nexa" Isaković.

      <div class="text">
         <p>
            At the age of 14, NiKo kicked off his career in Counter-Strike 1.6, competing in the local Balkan scene with eu4ia and iNation, teams with whom he went on to attend Adepto BH Open 2011 and DreamHack Bucharest 2012 <br> over the following two years — falling to two different fnatic lineups in the quarter-finals of both events. Following the release of CS:GO, NiKo continued to play for iNation, gaining experience following the additions of Janko "YNk" Paunović <br> and Nemanja "k1Ng0r" Bošković while playing in a handful of notable events, including Mad Catz Vienna, DreamHack Bucharest, and SLTV StarSeries VIII Finals.
         </p>
         <p>
            NiKo began gaining notoriety as a rising star after that but took a step back from competition in 2014 after the dissolution of his team following internal issues, even rejecting an offer from MOUZ during his break as he felt he was too young <br> and wasn't ready to compete in an international lineup. It was only after he returned to play in local competitions that NiKo reconsidered his decision, accepting the call up to the German organization the next time they came knocking in early 2015. <br> Despite showcasing undeniable talent and making an immediate impression at ESEA Invite Season 18 Global Finals and ESL Meisterschaft: Spring Finals though, NiKo swiftly found himself benched from the team just two months into his tenure <br> as they grabbed a trio of PENTA players, returning to a German-speaking lineup and inheriting a spot at the ESL One Cologne 2016 Major.

         <p>
            sh1ro made his first appearances on HLTV way back in May 2018, playing a string of qualifiers with Russian mixes going by names such as team7, FLuffy Gangsters, and aimg0d. It was clear, even at this early stage, that the young AWPer possessed talent; <br> he racked up solid numbers across these qualifiers, even in defeat, one shining example being a 1.37 rating he achieved in a loss to forZe in the MSI MGA 2018 CIS closed qualifier.
         </p>
         <p>
            These brief forays into the upper echelons of Counter-Strike were short lived and with an array of different teammates, however by September of 2018 sh1ro, alongside future Gambit teammate Vladislav "nafany" Gorshkov, <br> had formed a stable roster going by the name of Vyalie Pitoni, and with this team the Russian began to build some real experience. They took an impressive resume of wins in a range of qualifiers, including a win against Winstrike at the WESG 2018 Russia closed qualifier, <br> and wins against Vega Squadron and Valiance at the DreamHack Open Atalanta 2018 qualifier. They were stopped in this final qualifier by Vitality, with sh1ro posting an impressive 1.23 rating even in defeat. <br> These promising performances earned sh1ro a call from Ivan "F_1N" Kochugov, and a shot to trial for Gambit's academy project.

            Ax1Le was introduced to the Counter-Strike series at a young age, four or five years old, when he would sit next to his father and watch him play different games on the computer, CS 1.6 being among them. When allowed to, <br> he would even sit and play a bit by himself, 15 or 20 minutes at a time, and with each passing year he would play more and more.
         </p>
         <p>
            He made the jump to CS:GO in 2014, starting to follow Major tournaments while ranking up in matchmaking all the way to Global Elite without any issues. Then it was time for something more serious, so he moved on to FACEIT, <br> where he reached level 10. "Why don't I create a team and try myself in different tournaments?" Ax1Le then thought, after going as far as he could individually, so he brought together some of his classmates and some friends from FACEIT <br> and made a team.

            HObbit's time in competitive CS began within the local Kazakh scene with a core of players that included the likes of Dastan "dastan" Akbayev, Bektiyar "fitch" Bahytov, and Adlet "keeN" Nyrseytov. They were quickly signed by Tengri, <br> and while the team played in mostly qualifiers for larger events, their biggest success with HObbit came when they played at Adrenaline Cyber League 2016.
         </p>
         <p>
            There, Tengri took down an early iteration of Gambit on LAN, with HObbit standing out as the highest rated player in the victory thanks to a huge performance on the first map Train. This likely impressed the Gambit side, <br> as just a couple weeks later they signed HObbit alongside Danylo "Zeus" Teslenko, creating the lineup that would go on to win PGL Krakow.

         <p>
            electroNic's competitive background dates back to the early 2010s in Counter-Strike 1.6, but being just 11 years old the Russian only appeared at some local events without finding much success at the time. It wasn't until he was 16 and when CS:GO <br> had gained widespread popularity that he started to make it in the top CIS scene, getting noticed by one of the veterans in the scene in Dmitry "hooch" Bogdanov and appearing in HLTV.org's records with ACES in 2015.
         </p>
         <p>
            Playing alongside names such as Roman "CyberFocus" Dergach and Ilya "fix" Golovko in Empire in 2016, electroNic quickly made his name as an up-and-coming player. Within a year and a half from his first HLTV-recorded match <br> he made another step up to the second-best team in the region, FlipSid3, teaming up with Andrey "B1ad3" Gorodenskiy for the first time and getting to hone his craft further under the tutelage of the seasoned in-game leader.

            YEKINDAR began his CS career much like anyone else, playing in small tournaments with teams made up of his fellow countrymen, working hard to grind his way to the top. He first showed up on HLTV with Latvian team Wolsung, <br> posting solid numbers whilst playing in small local and Baltic LAN events. At one such event, the GameOn III Finals in Lithuania, he was spotted by Dmitry "hooch" Bogdanov, who scouted him for his team at the time, EPG. <br> YEKINDAR did something not many from his country have managed by overcoming the lack of opportunities in Latvia:

            b1t established himself as a prodigy-level talent to emerge from the CIS region in 2021, and his path, unlike most players, hasn't been rooted in multiple years of grinding Counter-Strike at a professional level.
         </p>
         <p>
            After gaining an early interest in the franchise from watching his uncle play when he was little, b1t picked up CS:GO casually, mostly focused on playing the game with friends in pick-up games as he honed his own abilities. <br> His first recorded matches on HLTV didn't come until May 2019 when he took part in the CIS Minor open qualifiers for the StarLadder Berlin Major with NOTBAD at the age of 16, with whom he managed to secure a berth to the closed stage. <br> There, the team fell in their opening round to Vega Squadron, but managed to claim the scalp of EXTREMUM before being eliminated by Unique.

            The Russian AWPer first popped on the radar in April of 2017. As an 18-year-old, Jame recorded his first HLTV matches under the tag NOVA in SLTV Pro Series XVII, playing alongside Pavel "PASHANOJ" Legostaev and Dmitry "dimasick" Matvienko. <br> A similar squad made a deep run in the qualifier for the CIS Minor soon after, but Bogdan "naumoff" Naumov's active VAC ban saw them disqualified from the event.
         </p>
         <p>
            Jame left that core of players behind to join AVANGAR in August of 2017, which ended up being a career-defining move. He accepted the invitation to play in the Kazakh-based roster and linked up with teammates to this day Aleksei "Qikert" Golubev <br> and Timur "buster" Tulepov thanks to an invite from dimasick.

            device started out in Counter-Strike: Source as a teenager, playing his first local LAN at the age of 13 before making his way up the ranks until he was teamed up with Henrik "FeTiSh" Christensen for a brief period before the launch of Global Offensive. <br> Having become a consistent force over the years, his early days were far from it, as device was unable to hold a team for long due to a lack of focus, leaving or getting kicked as commitment levels waned.

         <p>
            His CS:GO career started in 2012 with CPH Wolves, in a squad the likes of FeTiSh and Steffen "3k2" Markussen, as well as a young Peter "dupreeh" Rasmussen, although he was let go and it wasn't until his return in 2013, with Andreas "Xyp9x" Højsleth <br> also on the roster, that he started to make a name for himself. His early days in 2013 didn't end up in any personal accolades, but by 2014 and under the banner of Dignitas he made the top 20 players of the year list for the first time, in 20th place, <br> as he and his teammates made several deep playoff runs during the year, including at all three Majors.

            Having recently turned 26, huNter- has been making the rounds in the competitive Counter-Strike scene for much longer than many people might realize. While his CS:GO background only dates back to 2015, years before that he played on the Balkan scene in <br> CS 1.6 at a young age, but the switch to the new game saw him take a sabbatical. It was none other than his cousin and now teammate Nikola "NiKo" Kovač who brought him back and persuaded him to give CS:GO a real shot, <br> and from there it didn't take long for huNter- to come up through the ranks with teams such as GamePub and iNation alongside the likes of Nestor "LETN1" Tanić and Luka "emi" Vuković.
         </p>
         <p>
            It was under Binary Dragons and later Valiance that the team started to appear more on the international scene once they were able to go full-time in 2017, and that's when huNter- himself began to garner some notoriety, with many people taking notice <br> of the shared last name with his cousin as well as the talent. In 2018, under the latter banner he got his first taste of playing in an English-speaking roster when Nemanja "nexa" Isaković, Rokas "EspiranTo" Milasauskas, and Otto "ottoNd" Sihvo were brought in, <br> and it was this core that went on to find success throughout 2019.

Before that he was merely another talented fish in a sea of Danish talent, playing with a small group of players that included <br> close friend Bjarke "miNd" Benjaminsen. But unlike most Danes, who work their way through the local scene, often playing under names such as Danny "BERRY" Krüger or Dennis "sycrone" Nielsen before being picked up by one of the elite Danish squads, <br> blameF took a different route.
         </p>
         <p>
            Instead, blameF joined Great Danes, not exactly a household name but the most notable team that he had gotten the chance to play on to date, and with them he began to accrue some all-important LAN experience. One notable tournament was the BYOC qualifier for <br> Copenhagen Games 2018, where with Great Danes blameF was able to catapult himself into the spotlight with an upset victory over Mathieu "Maniac" Quiquerez's LDLC squad. His individual performances impressed, so much so that he was eventually signed by <br> tier-one feeder team, Epsilon.

            The top 20 is not a place unfamiliar to NAF, who has now placed on the list three times within four years. However, before finding a long-term home within Liquid in early 2018, NAF was somewhat of a journeyman. <br> Being part of the initial Denial lineup that was picked up by Liquid in 2015, he found himself quickly replaced after only a couple months by the one and only Jonathan "EliGE" Jablonowski.
         </p>
         <p>
            NAF then bounced around a couple of different teams during the rest of 2015, first of which was Luminosity. This was the Canadian organization's first CS:GO team, based originally on one of the earliest Mythic lineups. <br> Featuring the likes of Jacob "pyth" Mourujärvi and Peter "ptr" Gurney, NAF only remained on the team for two months before moving on.

            KSCERATO dove headfirst into Counter-Strike in 2009 with his brother, Kauan "kNc" Cerato, grinding the game as he developed his talents through the echelons of Brazilian Counter-Strike, committed so much so to the game that he would skip school <br> to play at a LAN house. Continued participation at local LANs in São Paulo helped to further add experience to his game through to 2015, when he attended his first notable event, r1seCup, losing to a Dexterity roster that featured Marcelo "coldzera" David.
         </p>
         <p>
            It wasn't until 2018, though, that KSCERATO made a momentous career jump, joining FURIA's academy project alongside Vinicius "VINI" Figueiredo. The pair played for the roster for a little over a week before being promoted to the organization's main team, <br> where they would go on to remain inseparable for nearly four years, initially making a name for themselves in the South American scene. Despite some struggles in qualifying for international events, that FURIA lineup secured a number of local titles <br> and became a dominant team in the region, culminating in an Americas Minor qualification for the FACEIT London Major before they made the move out to Miami to have the opportunity to regularly face top competition.

            stavn discovered Counter-Strike as do many who have older siblings, by watching them play before picking it up themselves, and it was with no other than with his older brother Jacob "dragonfly" Lund that the young Dane joined his first team, walkover, <br> with whom he traveled around Denmark playing and sleeping in sports halls around the country.
         </p>
         <p>
            One of the key events in the youngster's development was PowerLAN 2016, where stavn was playing in the BYOC tournament while all of the big Danish organizations played the main event. He got to play his first match against a bigger team there, <br> Tricked — who were playing from the VIP area as opposed to the main hall —, and Casper "cadiaN" Møller took some time to stand behind the 14-year-old and watch him.

            Twistzz's beginnings were similar to others in the North American scene, as he worked his way up through the ESEA ranks with smaller teams and also had the chance to improve by playing against the region's best players in FPL. <br> His progression compared to many of his peers was much quicker, however, as within a few months of making his first appearance in HLTV.org records he got to play for his first big organization.
         </p>
         <p>
            As one of the hottest prospects on the lower-tier scene in the region, the Canadian youngster got the opportunity to join Kory "SEMPHIS" Friesen and Pujan "FNS" Mehta's TSM in early 2016, and with them he was able to hone his craft and gain experience <br> at a fast rate at just 16 years old. Although his young age caused him to miss ELEAGUE Season 1 due to the organizer setting the age requirement at 17, the first international foray came almost immediately for Twistzz, as he made it to the ECS Season 1 Finals <br> shortly after that and challenged some of Europe's greats such as fnatic on the way to his first semi-final appearance on the tier-one level.

          <p>
            By now, the tale of ropz's rise to the upper echelons of CS:GO will be a familiar one to many. A PUG star who rose through the ranks of the FACEIT matchmaking system, his talent was apparent almost immediately. Such was his talent that he faced cheating accusations <br> and vitriol from the pro community just as immediately, with one of the most storied professionals at the time, Jesper "JW" Wecksell, stating on stream that ropz would "never show up at a LAN." In the end, FACEIT invited the young Estonian to play some games <br> from their offices in March 2017 to quell the furore that was threatening to endanger an innocent player's career. It wasn't long after this that he joined MOUZ.
          </p>
          <p>
            It took a little bit of time for ropz to settle at the professional level, which was understandable given that his only experience in a team environment up to that point had been in mix teams at low level online cups and qualifiers. His first LAN event with MOUZ, <br> DreamHack Open Tours 2017, was underwhelming, as he posted a 0.97 rating over five maps, making him the second-worst performer on the team. At his very next event however, the far more prestigious ESL Pro League Season 5 Finals, he impressed with a 1.12 rating <br> as he lead the way for his team to a respectable 5-6th place finish. This inconsistent form characterised his first six months as a pro, but it wasn't long before he found his feet and began his trajectory towards being the player we know him as today.

         <p>
            EliGE gained early Counter-Strike experience as a casual player of 1.6, but truly began sinking his teeth into the competitive side of esports with Starcraft 2, a real-time strategy game that he played for nearly three years before shifting his focus to CS:GO <br> after the beta period, diving head-first into the title in 2013. Just 15-years-old at the time, the young talent quickly rose through the ranks in North America, playing in CEVO Professional and ESEA Premier on Justus Pro with Peter "ptr" Gurney <br> before later making the move to ELEVATE, joining David "Xp3" Garrido and William "RUSH" Wierzba.
         </p>
         <p>
            Alongside the pair, EliGE placed 3-4th at his first international event, Clutchcon 2015, beating Tarik "tarik" Celik's CLG in the quarter-finals before losing to Cloud9. Just two months later, he made the move to the team where he has spent the rest of his career to date, <br> replacing Keith "NAF" Markovic on Liquid. Though results didn't pour in immediately, the experience competing in a top team proved crucial as EliGE's growth as an individual was exponential, with him attending his first Major, DreamHack Open Cluj-Napoca, <br> just seven months later.

         broky's road to the top echelons of Counter-Strike was typical of the new generations of stars. He took a casual interest in the game through a sibling during the days of CS 1.6, gained interest in the pro scene after witnessing the game's evolution and crowded arenas, <br> and finally realized he could pursue a professional career after seeing Robin "ropz" Kool given a contract thanks to his accomplishments in FPL.
        </p>
        <p>
         While broky played a couple of regional LANs under the banner of Wolsung, his development didn't come from within the domestic scene. Countryman Mareks "YEKINDAR" Gaļinskis spoke about that rapid development in 2019, explaining that broky got into FACEIT's <br> elite pick-up game circuit faster than the rumors of his talent could spread within the country. It was FPL, where he showed he could stand his ground against the best in the world, that got him invited to play in the three teams he had in his career: Wolsung, Epsilon, and FaZe.
